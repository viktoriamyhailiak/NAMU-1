# NAMU Museum Landing Page

NAMU Museum Landing Page is a responsive landing page created according to a Figma design to present a modern art museum, its exhibitions, events, and gallery.
The project is implemented using BEM methodology and SCSS, with a strong focus on clean structure, consistent animations, and accessibility across all screen sizes.

The landing page provides smooth navigation between sections, interactive visuals, and a clear user flow, making it easy for visitors to explore exhibitions, subscribe to updates, and learn more about the museum.
